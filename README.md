# Interactive Dice Game

Welcome to the Interactive Dice Game, a fun and simple game for two players. Here's how you play:

## How to Play
- **Roll the Dice**: Click the "Roll Dice" button to roll the virtual dice. A random number between 1 and 6 will show up, just like rolling a real dice.
- **Accumulate Points**: If you roll any number between 2 and 6, those points get added to your current score. Keep rolling to increase your points!
- **Switch Turns**: Be careful! If you roll a 1, you lose all points for that turn, and it's the next player's turn.
- **Hold Your Score**: Feeling lucky? You can choose to "hold" your current score at any time. This adds your current points to your total score, and then it's the other player's turn.
- **Winning the Game**: The game continues until one player decides to hold their score and ends up with the highest total. That player is the winner!

## Features
- **Random Dice Rolls**: Experience the thrill of chance as each roll could change the game's outcome.
- **Active Player Indicator**: Easily see whose turn it is, as the game highlights the active player.
- **Score Tracking**: Watch your points grow with each successful roll, and strategize when to hold them.
- **Turn-Based Gameplay**: Take turns and plan your moves carefully‚Äîeach roll can lead to victory or a sudden switch in players.
- **Winner Announcement**: The game will announce the winner once someone holds a score that beats the other player.

So, gather a friend, start rolling, and may the best roller win! üé≤üèÜ
