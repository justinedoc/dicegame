# Interactive Dice Game

This project is a web-based interactive dice game designed for two players. The game is built with vanilla JavaScript and showcases the use of DOM manipulation, event handling, and conditional logic to create an engaging user experience.

## Features
- **Random Dice Rolls**: Simulate rolling a real dice with random number generation.
- **Active Player Highlighting**: Visually indicates the current player's turn.
- **Score Accumulation**: Players can accumulate points with each roll, adding a strategic element to the game.
- **Turn Switching**: Automatically switches turns when a player rolls a 1 or chooses to hold their score.
- **Winner Declaration**: A function to declare the winner based on the accumulated scores (to be implemented).

This game is a demonstration of front-end development skills, including responsive design, and can serve as a fun portfolio piece to showcase problem-solving and interactive web development abilities.
